# **A Pawsitively Perfect Survey** - A Milestone Project

## __Introduction__
---

Hello!

Welcome to a Code Institute milestone project - This is my third project as part of CI's Full Stack Diploma in Software Development.

This project was created with Python 3 and is a user survey for the company that my first project was based off; "Pawsitively Perfect Pet Care" (Which is a real company, owned by my mother!)

The purpose of this short survey is to garner responses from customers to establish how happy they are with the service provided by Pawsitively Perfect Pet Care.

I appreciate you taking the time to look over this project and I am eager to explain more about it below.

## __Features__

## __Testing__
---

I have tested this project manually:

It has also been validator tested through:
- [PEP8 online check](http://pep8online.com/)
    - Upon first check, the validator returned 2 yellow errors.
        - This was due to whitespace within the code.
        - This was quickly removed and the code was pushed to github and tested once more through the validation process.
            - The second check came back with an "All right" result.

## __Credits__
---

- Code Institute for the deployment terminal and template.
- Code inspired by Code Institute's Anna Greaves' "Love Sandwiches" walkthrough project; including main structure and influence for the valid_answers validation loop.

## __Acknowledgements__

- As always, I'm thankful to the below groups and people for support during this project:
    - Code Institute's Slack: Several students helped support me with queries.
    - #london-community Slack Channel: Support, inspiration, shared resources and reviews of code are the main reasons I managed to complete this project.
    - [w3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp): For being an amazing font of tutorials and knowledge for new coding students such as myself.
